## Introduction

**Glacier** brings incremental interactive unit testing to [Gleam](https://gleam.run).
It is meant as a drop-in replacement for [Gleeunit](https://hexdocs.pm/gleeunit) and it relies on it, internally.

*Glacier* differs from *Gleeunit* insofar, that it let's you:

1. Pass in the `glacier` flag like so: `gleam test -- --glacier`, save a module and only related tests will rerun.
2. Or Pass in a specific unit test modules to rerun `gleam test -- test/my_module_test.gleam`.
3. If `gleam test` is passed without any `--`-arguments it behaves the same as *Gleeunit*.
4. You can still pass in `--target erlang` or `--target javascript` like so `gleam test --target erlang -- --glacier`, or like `gleam test --target javascript -- test/my_module_test.gleam`.

To enable this behavior, all you have to do is add *Glacier* as a dev dependency, aka `gleam add glacier`, open `./test/YOUR_PROJECT.gleam` and replace `gleeunit.main()` with `glacier.main()`.

### Testing against Erlang & JavaScript

- Simply run `gleam test --target erlang -- --glacier` and `gleam test --target javascript -- --glacier` in two tabs side by side.

## Installation & Usage

For Erlang this library depends on [fs](https://hexdocs.pm/fs/). Because of this on Linux you will need [`inotify-tools` to be installed](https://github.com/synrc/fs#backends). On Mac and Windows it should work out of the box.

For JavaScript/NodeJS this library depends on [`fsPromises.watch`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fspromiseswatchfilename-options) and thus [relies](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/fs.html#fs_caveats) on [`inotify`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify) for Linux. On Mac and Windows it should work out of the box.

This package is available on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm) can be added to your Gleam project:

1. Run `gleam add glacier`
2. Open `./test/YOUR_PROJECT.gleam` and replace `import gleeunit` with `import glacier` and `gleeunit.main()` with `glacier.main()`
3. Run `gleam test -- --glacier`
   - Save any test module (within `./test`) file to re-run that single test
   - Save any src module (within `./src`) to run all associated tests. Associated tests are test modules where the module is imported or where any of the module's imports and their import's imports (import chain) are imported into.

... and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/glacier>.

### Supported Erlang/OTP and JavaScript versions

Development and testing only happens on very recent stable Erlang/OTP and recent NodeJS LTS versions, it thus may or may not run on previous versions.

## How does it work?

1. `gleam test` passes through `glacier.run()` and simply executes `gleeunit.main()` as if *Gleeunit* was used directly.
2. `gleam test -- test_module_a test_module_b` passes through `glacier.run()` and executes `gleeunit.test_modules(modules_list)` where `modules_list` is `["foo", "bar"]`. The given modules are checked if they exist as either `.gleam` or `.erl` test module files and then *Gleeunit* runs these test modules.
3. `gleam test -- --glacier` enters `glacier.run()` and starts a file watcher: Upon changes in module files in `./test` it just passes those through as `gleam test -- changed_test_module`(so re-saving test files executes the single test), and if a module file in `./src` got changed it parses that changed module file for any imported modules and puts the module and all chained imported modules in a distinct list of modules that should be tested. Then all test module files are read and imports of those are gathered one by one and cross matched against that list. The result is a list of test modules that need to be run, which then gets done by executing a shell call similar to `gleam test -- detected_test_module_a detected_test_module_b detected_test_module_c etc`, aka jumps to `2.`.

## Developing Glacier

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inoas/glacier.git
cd glacier
# Show instructions how to use the library stand alone:
gleam run
# Run the tests on this library:
gleam test --target erlang
gleam test --target javascript
gleam test --target erlang -- --glacier
gleam test --target javascript -- --glacier
```

## Possible improvements

- Erlang: Introduce some delay between the file watcher picking up a change and the test running, so that if you find-replace-save-all via an editor it does not try to run the tests 10 times. This requires some medium large changes as the code to detect imports and dependent imports needs to run for 1..n modules and if test modules are affected it needs to be handled separately (added afterwards distinct, unique).
- Gleam 0.26+: Handling of JavaScript src and test modules for DENO: <https://deno.land/api@v1.29.1?s=Deno.watchFs>.
- Speed: Save import lists per module into an in-memory hash-table. Before a file gets parsed for its imports, build the hash and check if a cached version already exists.
- Handling of Elixir `src` and `test` modules.
- Handling of JavaScript `src` and `test` modules.
